    <h2>Course Description</h2>

    <p class="info_text">In this course students will learn the fundamentals of computation, software design, and web technologies, through a series of creative projects. The course is intended to equip students with the skills to develop artistic and business projects that include a significant computational component. Topics such as variables, functions, components, and functional and reactive <a href="https://fanyi.baidu.com/?aldtype=85#en/zh/programming">programming</a> will be brought together to create interactive applications, generative art, and other domains. Within the framework of these creative projects students will develop a greater understanding of how computer programs operate, be exposed to various concepts used to create experiences and interactions, and become more familiar with some of the technologies that constitute the internet. This course is intended for students with no prior programming background.</p>

    <h2>Course Overview and Learning Outcomes</h2>

    <p class="info_text">Students will learn computational thinking, program design, and debugging, within a creative context. They will learn elementary theory of color, sound, animation, sound, and text, in the course of writing programs that use these elements. Over the course of a series of individual and group projects, they will develop project development and project management skills and presentation skills. They will reflect on their workflows as an example of a process, on similarities between the process of developing a program and improving a workflow, and on other wider applications of computational thinking and systems thinking. They will learn some tools of coding, web development, and collaborative programming.</p>
